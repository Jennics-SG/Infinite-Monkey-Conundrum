SCENE VII. London. The palace.


Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, QUEEN ELIZABETH,	CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, a Nurse with the	young Prince, and Attendants
KING EDWARD IV
Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
And two Northumberlands; two braver men
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
And made our footstool of security.
Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.


GLOUCESTER
[Aside]  I'll blast his harvest, if your head were laid;
For yet I am not look'd on in the world.
This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave;
And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:
Work thou the way,--and thou shalt execute.


KING EDWARD IV
Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.


CLARENCE
The duty that I owe unto your majesty
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.


QUEEN ELIZABETH
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.

GLOUCESTER
And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.
[Aside]  To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master,
And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.


KING EDWARD IV
Now am I seated as my soul delights,
Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.


CLARENCE
What will your grace have done with Margaret?
Reignier, her father, to the king of France
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
And hither have they sent it for her ransom.


KING EDWARD IV
Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
And now what rests but that we spend the time
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.


Exeunt
